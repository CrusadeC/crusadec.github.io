        <p>Hi. I am Zi Kang. Most people know me as Crusade. I'm Malaysian and I studied Contemporary Music (Audio Technology) for my degree and here is where I expand my interests delving into Computer Science and web development.</p>
        <p>You can think of this website as my personal blog where I share some of my experience volunteering at Anime, Comic & Games (ACG) events while also experimenting with software. Nonetheless, thank you for coming by and accompany me on my CS50X journey.</p>
        <p>This is what I'm trying out on right now:</p>
